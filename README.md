# Low-cost Magnetic Field Mapper

Repository for the OPEL research magnetic field mapper.

An easy way to get repeatable precise movements for use in measuring the magnetic field of an object is to write a script for an old 3D printer. This script is developed to measure one of our hall-effect ion thrusters and validate simulation data.
